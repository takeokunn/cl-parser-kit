;; The DECLARE-stripping LOOP just below (and its twin in

;; whatever test file calls ASSERT-COMBINATOR-SUCCESS/-FAILURE -- never at
;; program-execution time, so SB-COVER can never mark it covered no matter how
;; many call sites pass a leading DECLARE (verified: several tests do, and
;; still count 0 hits here). A third variant of the two attribution artifacts
;; already documented in CONTRIBUTING.md, not a real gap.
