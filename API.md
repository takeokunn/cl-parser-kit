# API Guide

This document groups the public `:cl-parser-kit` exports by concern and shows
the normal entry points for each layer.

For the exact symbol list, see [`src/package.lisp`](./src/package.lisp).
For parser-construction guidance organized by grammar shape, see
[`PARSING_PATTERNS.md`](./PARSING_PATTERNS.md).

## Spans

Use spans when you need source positions that survive tokenization, parsing,
and diagnostics.

- type: `span`
- constructors: `make-span`
- accessors: `span-source`, `span-start`, `span-end`, `span-start-line`,
  `span-start-column`, `span-end-line`, `span-end-column`
- helpers: `span-length`, `span-empty-p`, `span-merge`,
  `span-contains-position-p` (is a character offset inside the half-open span),
  `span-text` (the source substring the span covers, defaulting to the span's own
  `span-source`)

## Tokens

Tokens carry lexical meaning and source metadata.

- type: `token`
- constructor: `make-token`
- accessors: `token-type`, `token-text`, `token-value`, `token-metadata`,
  `token-span`, `token-start`, `token-end`
- stream helper: `filter-tokens` returns a fresh vector of the tokens satisfying
  a predicate, for pruning a stream before parsing (e.g. dropping non-skipped
  `:comment` tokens)
- when tokens come from an external pipeline, `token-metadata` may carry
  plist-style `(:source <string>)`; diagnostics use it together with
  `token-start` / `token-end` to recover line/column data when `token-span`
  is absent

Typical usage starts with a tokenizer and ends with a vector of tokens.

- [`examples/external-token-diagnostic-example.lisp`](./examples/external-token-diagnostic-example.lisp)

## Tokenizers

Tokenizer helpers keep the lexical layer independent and REPL-friendly.

- tokenizer type: `tokenizer`
- constructor: `make-tokenizer`
- tokenizer accessors: `tokenizer-rules`
- rule type: `token-rule`
- rule constructor: `make-token-rule`
- rule accessors: `token-rule-type`, `token-rule-matcher`, `token-rule-skip-p`
- built-in rules: `make-literal-rule`, `make-keyword-rule`,
  `make-whitespace-rule`,
  `make-identifier-rule`, `make-number-rule`, `make-string-rule`,
  `make-predicate-rule`, `make-char-rule`, `make-line-comment-rule`,
  `make-block-comment-rule`, `make-nested-block-comment-rule`
- numeric and operator rules: `make-radix-integer-rule`, `make-float-rule`,
  `make-operator-rule`
- entry points: `tokenize`, `tokenize-string`

`make-char-rule` matches exactly one character described by a `character`, a
string/list of characters (any member), or a predicate function, with an
optional `:value-function`; it is the single-character counterpart to
`make-predicate-rule` (which scans a run) and suits punctuation and one-character
operators.

`make-literal-rule` performs raw prefix matching and is a good fit for
punctuation and operators. Use `make-keyword-rule` when a reserved word should
match only at identifier boundaries, such as `let`.

`make-identifier-rule` accepts `:start-predicate` and `:continue-predicate`
for languages whose identifiers allow sigils or suffix markers. When reserved
words should respect that same custom alphabet, pass the matching
`identifier-char-predicate` to `make-keyword-rule`. Pass `:case-sensitive nil`
to `make-keyword-rule` for case-insensitive keywords (`SELECT`, `select` and
`Select` all match `select`, while the token text and value stay the canonical
literal).

`make-radix-integer-rule` reads integers in base 2..36 introduced by an optional
`:prefix` (matched case-insensitively, e.g. `0x`, `0b`, `0o`), producing the
integer value via `parse-integer` -- never the reader. `make-float-rule` reads a
floating literal with an optional fractional part and an optional decimal
exponent (`3.14`, `1e10`, `2.5e-3`), yielding a `double-float` (or the
`:float-type` requested); it matches only lexemes carrying a fractional part or
exponent unless `:require-fractional nil`, and leaves a leading sign to the
parser unless `:allow-sign t`. `make-operator-rule` matches the longest of a set
of operator strings, so `==` wins over `=` without hand-ordering separate literal
rules.

`make-nested-block-comment-rule` matches block comments that nest (Rust
`/* .. /* .. */ .. */`, Common Lisp `#| .. |#`), unlike `make-block-comment-rule`
which stops at the first close. `make-string-rule` accepts `:escapes`, an alist
of `(escaped-char . replacement-char)`, to decode escape sequences such as `\n`
into their control characters; a character absent from the alist is taken
literally.

- `tokenize` rejects a source longer than `*maximum-tokenizer-source-length*`,
  stops once it has emitted `*maximum-tokenizer-tokens*` tokens, and rejects a
  tokenizer with more than `*maximum-tokenizer-rules*` rules, all by signaling
  `tokenizer-resource-limit-exceeded` (accessors
  `tokenizer-resource-limit-exceeded-kind`,
  `tokenizer-resource-limit-exceeded-value`,
  `tokenizer-resource-limit-exceeded-limit`) instead of exhausting memory;
  rebind tokenizer limits for intentionally large inputs
- tokenizer rule constructors that accept computed alternative sets, currently
  `make-operator-rule`, reject more than
  `*maximum-tokenizer-rule-alternatives*` alternatives with
  `tokenizer-resource-limit-exceeded`
- `make-number-rule` caps a single numeric lexeme at
  `*maximum-number-lexeme-length*` characters so an adversarially long digit
  run cannot force multi-megabyte bignum arithmetic; the scanner simply stops
  there and the remaining digits start a new number token, the same graceful
  split already used for a stray interior `.`
- `make-float-rule` clamps the exponent magnitude at `*maximum-number-exponent*`
  and saturates on overflow (a huge positive exponent yields the largest
  representable float, a huge negative one yields zero), so a literal like
  `1e999999` neither builds a gigantic bignum nor traps

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics and parse failures preserve structured error data.

- diagnostic type: `diagnostic`
- constructor: `make-diagnostic`
- accessors: `diagnostic-kind`, `diagnostic-message`, `diagnostic-span`,
  `diagnostic-notes`, `diagnostic-fixes`, `diagnostic-data`
- render helper: `diagnostic->string` renders the main message, opt
  source excerpt, notes, and fix-it hints in a readable multiline form;
  `diagnostics->string` renders a whole list of diagnostics (blank-line
  separated), for a recovery parse's collected diagnostics
- `diagnostic->string` caps rendered notes and fix-it hints at
  `*maximum-diagnostic-related-count*`, signaling
  `diagnostic-resource-limit-exceeded` for externally constructed diagnostics
  with adversarially large or improper related-item lists; accessors:
  `diagnostic-resource-limit-exceeded-kind`,
  `diagnostic-resource-limit-exceeded-value`,
  `diagnostic-resource-limit-exceeded-limit`
- convenience constructors: `warning-diagnostic`, `error-diagnostic`,
  `note-diagnostic`, `fix-it`, `make-fix-it`
- fix-it accessors: `fix-it-span`, `fix-it-replacement`
- fix-it application: `apply-fix-it` returns source with one fix-it's span region
  replaced by its replacement; `apply-fixes` applies a list of fix-its
  while preserving source-relative spans. Non-overlapping fixes are emitted in
  source order, overlapping fixes keep last-to-first sequential semantics, and
  same-position zero-width insertions preserve input order. `apply-fixes`
  consumes at most `*maximum-diagnostic-fix-count*` input entries; `nil` entries
  are skipped for application but still counted. Excess data signals
  `diagnostic-resource-limit-exceeded` with kind `:fix-count`; circular or
  improper fix lists are rejected through the same condition. This turns
  suggestion data into corrected text -- e.g.
  `(apply-fixes source (diagnostic-fixes diagnostic))`
- parse failure helpers: `make-parse-failure`, `parse-failure-position`,
  `parse-failure-expected`, `parse-failure-actual`,
  `parse-failure-committed-p`,
  `parse-failure-diagnostics`, `parse-failure->string`,
  `merge-parse-failures`
- `parse-failure-span` returns the source span of the failure's actual token (or
  `nil` at end of input), a convenience for rendering a caret or slicing the
  offending source region without building a full diagnostic
- `parse-failure->diagnostics` returns the structured `diagnostic` objects for a
  failure (its attached diagnostics, or a synthesized default) -- the structured
  counterpart of `parse-failure->string`, for rendering or aggregating failures
  with your own tooling
- `parse-failure->string` is the stable top-level renderer for parse
  failures; it joins attached diagnostics when present and synthesizes a
  readable fallback message when only `expected` / `actual` data is available
- parse failure expected-item and attached-diagnostic lists are capped by
  `*maximum-parse-failure-expected-count*` and
  `*maximum-parse-failure-diagnostic-count*` during merge and rendering; excess
  data, circular lists, and improper list tails signal
  `parse-failure-resource-limit-exceeded` (accessors
  `parse-failure-resource-limit-exceeded-kind`,
  `parse-failure-resource-limit-exceeded-value`,
  `parse-failure-resource-limit-exceeded-limit`)
- `diagnostics->string` skips `nil` entries while streaming and caps the number
  of input list entries with `*maximum-diagnostic-count*`; excess data signals
  `diagnostic-resource-limit-exceeded`; circular or improper diagnostic lists
  are rejected through the same condition
- `parse-all` trailing-token failures preserve the actual trailing token and
  attach a diagnostic from the token span, falling back to `token-start` /
  `token-end` offsets or the current parser position when full span data is
  unavailable
- if that fallback path also has plist-style `(:source <string>)` in
  `token-metadata`, the synthesized diagnostic span includes reconstructed
  line/column positions and a renderable source excerpt
- `diagnostic->string` caps the rendered source excerpt and caret
  padding/width at `*maximum-diagnostic-line-length*` characters (appending an
  ellipsis when truncated), so a single pathological line -- a minified file
  with no line breaks, or a span far into an adversarially long line -- can't
  make one diagnostic allocate output proportional to that line's full length

## Parser Primitives

The parser combinators operate on token vectors and return parse results with a
failure object on error.

- parser object: `parser`, `make-parser`, `parser-name`, `parser-fn`
- execution: `run-parser`, `parse-tokens`, `parse-all`, `parse-source`,
  `parse`
- matching: `literal`, `type-token`, `satisfies-token`
- token projection helpers: `literal-text`, `literal-value`,
  `type-token-text`, `type-token-value`
- composition: `seq`, `alt`, `many`, `many1`, `chainl1`, `chainr1`, `opt`,
  `label`, `sep-by`, `sep-by1`, `sep-end-by`, `sep-end-by1`, `preceded-by`, `terminated-by`,
  `between`, `delimited-sep-by`, `delimited-sep-by1`, `delimited-sep-end-by`,
  `delimited-sep-end-by1`, `operator-parser`,
  `lookahead`, `not-followed-by`
- functional combinators: `map-parser`, `bind-parser`, `return-parser`
- failure context: `context` (append an explanatory `note-diagnostic` to a
  failure while leaving its expected form, actual token, and commitment intact --
  unlike `label`, which replaces the expected form)
- termination: `end-of-input`
- token navigation: `peek-token`, `next-token`, `eof-token-p`
- tree helpers reject malformed child lists with `tree-child-list-invalid`; use
  `tree-child-list-invalid-kind` to distinguish `:circular` from `:improper`
- `end-of-input` and `not-followed-by` attach diagnostics from the failing
  token span, falling back to `token-start` / `token-end` offsets when span
  data is unavailable, or to the current parser position as a last resort
- the same fallback path reconstructs multiline locations when the failing
  token carries `(:source <string>)` in `token-metadata`
- `alt` propagates the farthest branch failure; when multiple
  branches fail at that same farthest position, their expected forms are merged
- `lookahead` keeps the input position unchanged on success, while preserving
  the nested farthest failure position on error
- `opt`, `many`, and `sep-by` only recover from non-consuming failures; once a
  nested parser has committed input, the original failure is propagated
- `sep-end-by` and `sep-end-by1` mirror that recovery model, but treat a final
  separator plus a non-committing item failure as a successful trailing
  separator
- when that recovery carries diagnostics, observe them through `run-parser`;
  terminal entry points (`parse-tokens`, `parse-all`, `parse-source`,
  `parse-pratt-all`) only surface terminal parse failures
- `preceded-by` and `terminated-by` are thin value-projection wrappers over
  `bind-parser` / `map-parser`; they remove delimiter boilerplate without
  changing failure positions or commitment behavior
- `delimited-sep-by` and `delimited-sep-by1` are thin wrappers over
  `between` plus `sep-by` / `sep-by1`, so they inherit the same commitment and
  failure-position behavior
- `delimited-sep-end-by` and `delimited-sep-end-by1` are the corresponding
  wrappers over `between` plus `sep-end-by` / `sep-end-by1`
- `literal-text`, `literal-value`, `type-token-text`, and `type-token-value`
  are thin wrappers over `literal` / `type-token` plus `map-parser`, so they
  keep the underlying matcher failure behavior intact
- `operator-parser` is the same kind of thin wrapper over `map-parser`; it is
  intended for `chainl1` / `chainr1` operator parsers that should ignore the
  matched token and return a binary combiner function
- `(alt)` is defined and fails cleanly with `:alternative` instead of signaling
- large or deeply nested input is bounded by `*maximum-parser-recursion-depth*`:
  every combinator invokes its sub-parsers through `run-parser`, so once
  recursion (grammar nesting depth, or the length of a `chainr1` chain)
  exceeds it, parsing returns a `:maximum-recursion-depth` failure instead of
  exhausting the control stack; rebind it for intentionally large or deep
  grammars
- bounded repetition created with `times`, `times-between`, `at-most`, or
  `length-count` is capped by `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`; hostile
  construction-time bounds signal before allocating unbounded parser state, and
  hostile length-prefixed counts fail the parse instead of looping; rebind it
  for intentionally large bounded repetitions
- public token-stream boundaries are capped by `*maximum-parser-tokens*`;
  `run-parser`, `parse-tokens`, `parse-all`, `parse-pratt`, and
  `parse-pratt-all` return a `:maximum-parser-tokens` parse failure before
  walking oversized proper token lists or vectors; `filter-tokens` signals an
  error at the same limit; circular or improper token lists are rejected before
  traversal; source-oriented entry points also inherit this check after
  tokenization

### Extended Combinators

The following combinators build on the primitives above and inherit their
commitment model unchanged (a recoverable failure backtracks; a committed
failure propagates).

- token matching:
  - `any-token` — match any single token, failing only at end of input
  - `token-type-in` — match a token whose type is one of the given types; the
    failure's expected form is the list of types
  - `token-text-in` — match a token whose `token-text` is one of the given
    lexemes (the text counterpart to `token-type-in`)
  - `token-type-not-in` / `token-text-not-in` — the complements: match a token
    whose type / text is *none* of the given set (e.g. any token except a
    closing bracket), with an expected form of `(:not ...)`
  - `token-value-in` / `token-value-not-in` — match (or reject) a token whose
    `token-value` is one of a set of decoded payloads, completing the
    type/text/value matching family
  - token set combinators cap their argument count at
    `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`, so caller-constructed sets cannot
    create unbounded construction or membership work
  - `take-while` / `take-while1` — match a run of consecutive tokens satisfying a
    predicate, returning the list (`take-while1` requires at least one);
    Megaparsec's `takeWhileP` / `takeWhile1P`. `skip-while` skips such a run,
    discarding it
  - `satisfies-value` — match a token whose `token-value` satisfies a predicate,
    branching on a decoded payload rather than only the token type
- choice and value shaping:
  - `choice` — ordered choice over a *list* of parsers; the list form of `alt`
    (`(choice (list a b))` is `(alt a b)`), for alternatives computed at runtime
  - `sequence-of` — run a *list* of parsers in order, returning the list of
    values; the list form of `seq` (`(sequence-of (list a b))` is `(seq a b)`),
    the counterpart to `choice`
  - `option` — like `opt` but yields an explicit default value instead of `nil`
    when the parser does not match; a committed failure still propagates
  - `fail-parser` — always fails at the current position with a message
    (non-committed), turning a semantic guard into a parse error; accepts an
    `:expected` keyword to shape the failure's expected form
  - `as-value` — run a parser, discard its result, and yield a constant value,
    preserving the parser's consumption and commitment
  - `pure` — alias of `return-parser`, named for the Applicative operation
- backtracking control:
  - `attempt` — the inverse of `commit`: demote a parser's failure to a
    non-committed one so a surrounding `opt`/`many`/`sep-by` backtracks to the
    start position even after input was consumed (Parsec/Megaparsec's `try`).
    `alt` already backtracks unconditionally, so `attempt` matters for the
    commitment-respecting combinators, e.g.
    `(opt (attempt (seq (literal "else") (literal "if"))))`
- packrat memoization:
  - `memoize` — wrap a parser so that, inside a `with-parse-memoization` extent,
    its result at each position is computed once and reused on any later visit
    (turning an ambiguous / heavily backtracking grammar's exponential
    re-parsing into linear-time packrat parsing); a no-op outside the extent
  - `with-parse-memoization` — a macro establishing a fresh per-parse cache for
    the `memoize` parsers run inside it; wrap a top-level parse call
- permutation:
  - `permute` — parse a fixed set of parsers in any order, each exactly once,
    returning their values in the original argument order (attribute lists,
    keyword blocks); a committed sub-failure propagates, a recoverable one lets
    the other elements be tried, and a missing element fails; the parser count is
    capped by `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`
- repetition:
  - `times` — parse a parser exactly N times, returning the N results; N is
    capped by `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`
  - `skip-many` / `skip-many1` — parse zero-or-more / one-or-more and discard the
    results (yielding `t`) without allocating the intermediate list
  - `fold-many` / `fold-many1` — parse zero-or-more / one-or-more, folding each
    result into an accumulator (`(fold-many function initial parser)`) without
    building a list; `fold-many1` requires at least one match
  - `many-till` / `some-till` — parse repeatedly until an `end` parser matches,
    returning the collected results (`end`'s value is discarded and its input
    consumed); `some-till` requires at least one match before `end`
  - `length-count` — parse a count parser for a non-negative integer N, then
    parse an item parser exactly N times (length-prefixed sequences like
    `3 a b c`); N is capped by `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`, and each
    item must consume input, so a hostile count cannot loop
  - `not-empty` — run a parser but fail if it succeeded without consuming input,
    to guarantee forward progress before repeating an optional-matching parser
  - `chain-postfix` — parse a base, then apply zero or more suffix parsers
    left-to-right, each yielding a function that transforms the accumulated value;
    the left-associative suffix chain for member access, calls, and indexing
    (`primary .field (args) [i] ...`)
  - `chainl` / `chainr` — like `chainl1` / `chainr1` but yield a supplied default
    (consuming nothing) when the operand does not match even once
  - `times-between` — parse greedily between a minimum and maximum number of
    times; fewer than the minimum is a failure, a further recoverable failure
    past the minimum simply stops
  - `at-least` / `at-most` — the open-ended variants: `at-least` parses a minimum
    or more (`(at-least 0 p)` is `many`, `(at-least 1 p)` is `many1`), `at-most`
    parses zero up to a cap (`(times-between 0 max p)`)
  - `end-by` / `end-by1` — like `sep-by` but every item must be *followed* by the
    separator (a required terminator, e.g. `item ;` runs), as opposed to
    `sep-end-by`'s optional trailing separator
  - `surrounded-by` — parse a body wrapped in a matching delimiter on both sides,
    `(surrounded-by d p)` is `(between d p d)`, for quotes or symmetric brackets
- error recovery (panic-mode resynchronisation):
  - `skip-until` — consume tokens until one satisfies a predicate (optionally
    `:including` the match), always succeeding with the list of skipped tokens
  - `recover` — run a parser and, on failure, run a recovery parser from the
    failure position, keeping the failure's diagnostics on the recovered success
    so a single parse can report several errors; drive the surrounding loop with
    `(many-till statement (end-of-input))` so it halts on end of input
- applicative shaping and source spans:
  - `seq-map` — run parsers in sequence (`seq`) and apply a function to their
    results as separate positional arguments, e.g.
    `(seq-map #'make-node a b c)`; parser-list construction is capped by
    `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*` and the final function-call arity is
    capped by `*maximum-parser-apply-arity*`
  - `pick` — run parsers in sequence and keep only the N-th (0-based) result,
    e.g. `(pick 1 open body close)` keeps `body`; parser-list construction is
    capped by `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`
  - `pair` — run two parsers in sequence and return both results as a
    two-element list (nom's `pair`)
  - `separated-pair` — run `first separator second`, drop the separator, and
    return `(first-value second-value)` (nom's `separated_pair`)
  - `spanning` — run a parser and call `(function value span)` where `span`
    covers the tokens the parser consumed (or `nil` if none), for building
    located AST/CST nodes
  - `recognize` — run a parser, discard its value, and return the merged source
    span of the tokens it consumed (the span-only form of `spanning`)
- value constraints and cut:
  - `verify` — run a parser then require its value to satisfy a predicate, failing
    (non-committed, at the original position) when it does not; for semantic
    constraints a grammar cannot express structurally
  - `commit` — promote any failure of a parser to a committed one, a PEG-style
    cut so a surrounding `opt`/`many`/`sep-by` will not backtrack past it
  - `current-position` — succeed without consuming, yielding the current token
    index, to capture positions inside `parse-let*` / `seq-map`
- ergonomic macros:
  - `parse-let*` — sequential monadic binding (do-notation) that expands to
    nested `bind-parser` calls; each `(var parser-form)` binds `var` for the rest
    of the bindings and the body, whose value becomes the result (a `_` binding
    is ignored)
  - `parser-lazy` — defer building a parser expression until first use (memoized),
    enabling forward references and directly recursive grammars
  - `defparser` — define a function returning a `parser-lazy`-wrapped parser, so
    self- and mutually-recursive grammars can be written in natural order

Example:

```lisp
(let ((parser (cl-parser-kit:seq
               (cl-parser-kit:type-token :identifier)
               (cl-parser-kit:opt (cl-parser-kit:type-token :number))
               (cl-parser-kit:end-of-input))))
  parser)
```

```lisp
(cl-parser-kit:label
 (cl-parser-kit:type-token :identifier)
 :binding-name)
```

### Operator-Precedence Expression Builder

`make-expression-parser` builds an ordinary combinator parser from an operator
table — the combinator-layer counterpart to the token-keyed Pratt parser below.
Reach for it when the operands and operators are themselves arbitrary parsers
(rather than single tokens dispatched by type).

- `(make-expression-parser term table)` — `term` parses an operand; `table` is a
  list of precedence levels, **highest precedence first**. Each level is a list
  of operator specifications, each a `(keyword op-parser)` pair where `op-parser`
  yields the combining function:
  - `(:prefix op)` / `(:postfix op)` — unary, `op` yields a one-argument function
    (both may repeat within a level)
  - `(:infix-left op)` / `(:infix-right op)` — binary, `op` yields a two-argument
    function; associativity is handled internally via `chainl1` / `chainr1`
  - `(:infix-non-assoc op)` — binary with no chaining (`a op b` but not
    `a op b op c`)
- a level may combine any prefix/postfix operators with at most one infix
  associativity; mixing left- and right-associative infix operators in one level
  is ambiguous and signals an error at build time
- operator tables and operator sets are bounded by
  `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`, so computed or adversarially circular
  grammar tables fail at construction time instead of walking indefinitely
- built entirely on the verified primitives (`chainl1` / `chainr1`, `many`,
  `parse-let*`, `opt`, `alt`), so it inherits their commitment model

## Pratt Parsing

Pratt parsing is the best fit when you need expression precedence without a
large grammar framework.

- table: `pratt-table`, `make-pratt-table`
- entry types: `pratt-prefix-entry`, `pratt-infix-entry`, `pratt-postfix-entry`
- entry constructors: `make-pratt-prefix-entry`, `make-pratt-infix-entry`,
  `make-pratt-postfix-entry`
- accessors: `pratt-table-prefixes`, `pratt-table-infixes`,
  `pratt-table-postfixes`
- registration (low level, raw nud/led closures): `register-prefix-operator`,
  `register-infix-operator`, `register-postfix-operator`
- registration (high level, plain value builders — hide the nud/led protocol and
  binding-power arithmetic):
  - `register-atom` — a leaf token (`(builder token)`, consumes nothing further)
  - `register-prefix` — a unary prefix operator parsing one operand at a binding
    power (`(builder operand)`)
  - `register-infix-left` / `register-infix-right` — a binary operator of a given
    binding power, left- or right-associative (`(builder left right)`); the
    right-binding-power offset needed for associativity is handled internally
  - `register-postfix` — a unary postfix operator (`(builder operand)`)
  - `register-grouping` — a matched `open expr close` delimiter pair yielding the
    inner value, reporting a failure that expects the close key when it is missing
  - `register-ternary` — a right-associative ternary conditional
    `cond ? then : else` (`(builder cond then else)`), reporting a failure that
    expects the colon key when it is missing
  - `register-infix-non-assoc` — a non-associative binary operator: `a op b` is
    accepted but a chain `a op b op c` is a parse error
    (`:non-associative-operator`), as with many comparison operators
- parse entry points: `parse-pratt`, `parse-pratt-all`,
  `parse-pratt-source`
- `parse-pratt` and `parse-pratt-all` accept `:position` to start from a
  later token and `:min-binding-power` to parse only operators at or above a
  precedence floor
- `parse-pratt-source` passes the same `:position`
  and `:min-binding-power` keywords through after tokenization
- EOF and missing-prefix failures return `parse-failure` values instead of
  signaling internal errors
- large or deeply nested input is bounded by `*maximum-pratt-recursion-depth*`:
  once recursion (nesting depth, or the number of operators in a flat chain)
  exceeds it, parsing returns a `:maximum-recursion-depth` failure instead of
  exhausting the control stack; rebind it for intentionally large or deep
  grammars
- `parse-pratt-all` matches `parse-all`: it rejects trailing tokens while
  preserving the actual trailing token in the returned failure
- Pratt handlers use the same parser contract as other combinators:
  prefix/postfix/infix handlers return `(values t value next nil)` on success
  and may return `(values nil nil next failure)` for domain-specific failures

## Trees

AST and CST helpers keep tree-shaped output simple and explicit.

- AST: `ast-node`, `make-ast-node`, `ast-node-type`, `ast-node-value`,
  `ast-node-children`, `ast-node-span`, `ast-node-data`, `ast-node->sexp`
- CST: `cst-node`, `make-cst-node`, `cst-node-type`, `cst-node-value`,
  `cst-node-children`, `cst-node-span`, `cst-node-data`, `cst-node->sexp`
- construction (for both families): `token->ast-node` / `token->cst-node` build a
  leaf node from a token (its `value` from `:value-function`, `token-text` by
  default, and its `span` from the token); `ast-node-of` / `cst-node-of` run a
  parser and wrap the result into a node whose `span` covers the consumed tokens
  (the value goes in `value`, or in `children` with `:as-children t`)
- serialization (for both families): `ast-node->sexp` / `cst-node->sexp` render a
  node as a plist (optionally with `:include-span` / `:include-data`), and
  `sexp->ast-node` / `sexp->cst-node` reconstruct the node from that plist,
  rebuilding an embedded span — a round trip
  (`(ast-node-equal n (sexp->ast-node (ast-node->sexp n)))` is true)
- rendering (for both families): `ast-node->string` / `cst-node->string` render a
  human-readable indented tree (one node per line, `type` then `value`), for
  debugging and REPL inspection; `ast-node->dot` / `cst-node->dot` render a
  Graphviz DOT digraph (`:graph-name` names the graph) for visualizing a tree
  with `dot` — the machine-readable counterparts of the `->sexp` plist
- traversal (generated for both families): `ast-node-walk` / `cst-node-walk`
  visit every node for side effects (returning the root), in pre-order by default
  or post-order with `:order :post`;
  `ast-node-find` / `cst-node-find` return the first node satisfying a predicate
  (pre-order), or `nil`; `ast-node-map` / `cst-node-map` rebuild the tree
  bottom-up, replacing each node with the result of a function applied to a copy
  whose children have already been mapped (the original tree is left untouched)
- queries (also generated for both families): `ast-node-collect` /
  `cst-node-collect` return every node satisfying a predicate (pre-order list);
  `ast-node-count` / `cst-node-count` count nodes (matching an optional predicate,
  every node by default); `ast-node-depth` / `cst-node-depth` return the maximum
  depth (a leaf has depth 1)
- folding and comparison (for both families): `ast-node-reduce` /
  `cst-node-reduce` fold a function over every node from an initial accumulator
  (`(reduce-fn accumulator node)`, in `:order :pre` or `:post`);
  `ast-node-equal` / `cst-node-equal` test two trees for structural equality
  (equal type, value, and children), optionally including span
  (`:include-span t`) and data (`:include-data t`)
- resource limits: tree traversal, conversion, comparison, and rendering helpers
  enforce `*maximum-tree-depth*` and `*maximum-tree-nodes*`, signaling
  `tree-depth-limit-exceeded` with `tree-depth-limit-depth` /
  `tree-depth-limit-limit` for excessively deep inputs and
  `tree-node-limit-exceeded` with `tree-node-limit-count` /
  `tree-node-limit-limit` for excessively wide inputs; rebind them for
  intentionally large generated trees

## Testing

The repository test system runs on `cl-weave`, with `cl-prolog/weave`
providing declarative contract checks for parser behavior.

- primary entry point: `asdf:test-system "cl-parser-kit-test"`
- raw checkout script: `sbcl --script scripts/run-tests.lisp`
- coverage script: `sbcl --script scripts/run-coverage.lisp`

`cl-parser-kit-test.asd` executes the full suite through `cl-weave:run-all`
with the `:spec` reporter and treats an empty suite as a failure.

## Recommended Entry Points

If you are new to the library, start here:

1. tokenize source with `make-tokenizer` and `tokenize-string`
2. build token parsers with `seq`, `alt`, `many`, and `opt`
   For comma-separated or bracketed forms, start with `sep-by`, `sep-by1`,
   `sep-end-by`, `sep-end-by1`, `preceded-by`, `terminated-by`, `between`,
   `delimited-sep-by{,1}`, and `delimited-sep-end-by{,1}` instead of
   hand-rolling the control flow.
   For left- or right-associative operator chains outside Pratt parsing,
   start with `chainl1` or `chainr1`; pair them with `operator-parser` when
   the operator token itself does not carry semantic payload. `chainr1`
   recurses in step with the right-associative nesting depth; like the rest
   of the combinator engine, that depth is bounded by
  `*maximum-parser-recursion-depth*`, so adversarially deep input fails
  gracefully instead of exhausting the control stack. Bounded repetition is also
  capped by `*maximum-parser-repetition-count*`, so hostile construction-time
  bounds fail before allocating unbounded parser state and hostile
  length-prefixed counts fail instead of looping.
3. use `parse-tokens`, `parse-all`, or `parse-source` for end-to-end parsing
4. move to `parse-pratt`, `parse-pratt-all`, or `parse-pratt-source`
   when expression precedence matters
5. use `make-ast-node` or `make-cst-node` to shape downstream data
6. use `ast-node->sexp` or `cst-node->sexp` when you need stable,
   printable tree output for tests, examples, or REPL inspection
7. read [`PARSING_PATTERNS.md`](./PARSING_PATTERNS.md) when you need to choose
   between seq helpers, projected token payloads, operator-chain helpers,
   and Pratt parsing

## Parser Entry Points

End-to-end entry points intentionally stay small so combinator logic, Pratt
logic, and tokenizer construction remain separable:

- `run-parser` executes a parser at a position and returns four values:
  `ok`, `value`, `next-position`, and either diagnostics (success) or a
  parse failure (failure). Recursive parser execution is capped by
  `*maximum-parser-recursion-depth*`; token stream length is capped by
  `*maximum-parser-tokens*`
- `parse-tokens` accepts a parser and a token stream, and does not require the
  parse to consume every token; token stream length is capped by
  `*maximum-parser-tokens*`
- `parse-all` accepts a parser and a token vector, and enforces full
  consumption; token stream length is capped by `*maximum-parser-tokens*`
- `parse-source` tokenizes a source string with a tokenizer, then delegates to
  `parse-all`
- `parse-pratt` parses a precedence expression from a token vector; token
  stream length is capped by `*maximum-parser-tokens*`
- `parse-pratt-all` parses a precedence expression and enforces full
  consumption; token stream length is capped by `*maximum-parser-tokens*`
- `parse-pratt-source` tokenizes a source string, then delegates to
  `parse-pratt-all`
