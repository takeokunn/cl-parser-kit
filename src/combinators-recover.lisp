;;;; Error-recovery combinators (panic-mode resynchronisation).
;;;;
;;;; These deliberately turn a failure back into a success so parsing can
;;;; continue past a broken construct and report more than one error in a single
;;;; pass. The original failure's diagnostics are preserved on the SUCCESS path,
;;;; matching the library's existing recovery model: diagnostics carried through
;;;; a recovered success are observable via RUN-PARSER, while terminal entry
;;;; points (PARSE-TOKENS, PARSE-ALL, ...) still surface only hard failures.

  "Run PARSER; on failure, run RECOVERY from the failure position and take its
result, preserving PARSER's failure diagnostics on the recovered success.

If RECOVERY also fails, that failure propagates. Wrapping the per-item parser of
a repetition with RECOVER (RECOVERY typically SKIP-UNTIL a terminator, yielding
an error node) lets a single parse collect several errors instead of aborting at
the first one; read the accumulated diagnostics through RUN-PARSER. Drive the
repetition with (MANY-TILL statement (END-OF-INPUT)) rather than a bare MANY, so
the loop terminates on end of input instead of tripping MANY's non-advancing
guard when RECOVERY has nothing left to skip."
