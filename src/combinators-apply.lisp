;;;; Applicative-style combinators and source-span capture.

;;;; SEQ-MAP / PICK lift a function over SEQ's result list so callers rarely
;;;; need to destructure it by hand. SPANNING bridges the token stream's span
;;;; metadata into whatever value a sub-parser produces, which is the piece
;;;; most needed when building AST/CST nodes that must remember their source
;;;; location.
