(in-package :cl-parser-kit)

;;;; Permutation parsing.
;;;;
;;;; PERMUTE parses a fixed set of parsers that may appear in ANY order, each
;;;; exactly once, and returns their values in the ORIGINAL argument order. This
;;;; is the classic use case of attribute lists, keyword-argument blocks, and
;;;; record fields where order is irrelevant.
;;;;
;;;; The strategy is greedy first-match, which mirrors the commitment model used
;;;; throughout the library: at each round every not-yet-matched parser is tried
;;;; at the current position in original order; the FIRST that succeeds is taken.
;;;; A committed sub-failure propagates immediately (the element began matching
;;;; and then failed hard); a recoverable sub-failure just moves on to the next
;;;; candidate. When no remaining parser matches, the permutation is complete iff
;;;; every element has matched, otherwise it fails. Each parser is removed once
;;;; matched, so the loop runs at most N rounds and always terminates -- even if
;;;; some element matched without consuming input.
;;;;
;;;; Greedy first-match resolves an unambiguous permutation grammar (one whose
;;;; elements are distinguishable by their leading token) exactly; overlapping
;;;; alternatives should be disambiguated with ATTEMPT, as in ordinary ALT code.

matches the three attributes however they are arranged in the source and always
returns (name id class). A committed failure inside any element propagates; a
recoverable failure lets the other elements be tried first. Fails if any element
never matches. See ATTEMPT for disambiguating elements with overlapping starts."
