# Security Policy

`cl-parser-kit` is a small library, not a hosted service. Security reports
should therefore focus on repository content and verified library behavior from
this checkout.

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue in `cl-parser-kit`, report it privately to the
maintainer instead of opening a public issue.

Include:

- the affected commit or local checkout state
- the Common Lisp implementation and version you tested
- a minimal reproduction
- the impact you observed
- any suggested fix, if available

Do not publish exploit details until the issue has been acknowledged and a fix
has been coordinated.

## Scope

Reports are most actionable when they involve one of these areas:

- parser or tokenizer behavior that can be driven into unsafe or misleading
  states by untrusted input
- diagnostics that expose source text unexpectedly
- release or packaging metadata that points users at the wrong code or support
  channel
- example or documentation workflows that claim a security property the tests
  do not verify

## Support Boundary

The current verified baseline is the repository-local verification set
documented in [`SUPPORT.md`](./SUPPORT.md). On a machine with Nix, the whole
gate runs as a single reproducible command:

```sh
nix flake check
```

Without Nix, run the equivalent raw-checkout scripts directly:

```sh
sbcl --script scripts/run-compile-check.lisp
sbcl --script scripts/run-tests.lisp
sbcl --script scripts/run-examples.lisp
./scripts/run-implementation-smoke.sh
```

If a report depends on a different Lisp implementation, custom ASDF setup, or
downstream application embedding, include those details explicitly. Portability
issues may still matter, but they are easier to triage when separated from the
repository's current verified implementation set.

## Disclosure Expectations

- prefer private reporting first
- allow time to reproduce and narrow the root cause before public discussion
- once fixed, update the relevant tests or docs so the security contract is
  auditable from the repository
