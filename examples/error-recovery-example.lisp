;; when one is malformed, skip to the next `;` (recording an :error marker) and
;; keep going, so a single parse reports EVERY bad statement instead of aborting
;; at the first. The diagnostics collected during recovery ride the success path,
;; so they are read from RUN-PARSER's fourth value (the terminal PARSE-* entry
;; points deliberately surface only hard failures).
