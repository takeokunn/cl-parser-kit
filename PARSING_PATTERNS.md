# Parsing Patterns Guide

This guide documents the recommended parser construction patterns for
`cl-parser-kit`.

For the exported surface grouped by symbol, see [`API.md`](./API.md).
For runnable snippets, see [`EXAMPLES.md`](./EXAMPLES.md).

## Start With The Smallest Stable Layer

Choose the first layer that matches the grammar shape you actually have:

1. Start with `make-tokenizer` and `tokenize-string` when the source format is
   still changing and you need to inspect token boundaries first.
2. Start with `seq`, `alt`, `opt`, and `end-of-input` when the grammar is a
   short token sequence with one or two branch points.
3. Start with `sep-by`, `sep-end-by`, `preceded-by`, `terminated-by`, and
   `between` when delimiter control flow is more prominent than the item
   parser itself.
4. Start with `chainl1` or `chainr1` when the grammar is only a repeated
   operand/operator pair with fixed associativity.
5. Move to Pratt parsing only when prefix, infix, or postfix precedence
   layering becomes the dominant concern.

The library stays easier to audit when the parser shape mirrors the grammar
directly instead of hiding control flow in custom loops.

## Prefer Sequence Helpers Over Manual Delimiter Loops

If a token exists only to open, close, separate, or terminate another parser,
use the dedicated helper instead of spelling out the control flow manually.

- Use `preceded-by` when the prefix is syntax-only and callers only want the
  inner result.
- Use `terminated-by` when the suffix is syntax-only and the main parser must
  stay committed once it has consumed input.
- Use `between` when open/body/close delimiters should be treated as one unit.
- Use `delimited-sep-by` or `delimited-sep-by1` for bracketed lists that must
  reject a trailing separator.
- Use `delimited-sep-end-by` or `delimited-sep-end-by1` when the grammar
  should accept a final separator before the closing delimiter.

These helpers are thin wrappers around the same primitive combinators. They
remove boilerplate, but they do not weaken the underlying commitment or error
position rules.

## Choose The Right List Contract

The sequence helpers differ in one important behavioral boundary: what happens
after a separator has already matched.

- `sep-by` / `sep-by1` stop cleanly before a separator that never matched, but
  once a separator does match, the following item becomes mandatory.
- `sep-end-by` / `sep-end-by1` keep that same committed-item rule, yet recover
  from one final separator when the next item parser fails without consuming
  input.
- `delimited-sep-by*` and `delimited-sep-end-by*` inherit those same rules and
  add explicit open/close delimiter handling around the list body.

Use the strict `sep-by` family when a trailing separator would be a grammar
bug. Use the `sep-end-by` family when a trailing separator is part of the
language contract.

## Project Payloads Early When Syntax Tokens Are Noise

If downstream code should not care about raw token objects, project token text
or values at the parser boundary.

- Use `type-token-text` or `type-token-value` when the token type is the real
  match contract and callers only need the payload.
- Use `literal-text` or `literal-value` when a literal token carries
  meaningful semantic data in `token-value`.
- Use `operator-parser` with `chainl1` / `chainr1` when the operator token is
  syntax-only and you want the parser to return a combiner function directly.

This keeps parse results closer to the data model and removes repetitive
`token-text` / `token-value` extraction from later phases.

## Treat Committed Failures As A Public Contract

Combinator recovery in `cl-parser-kit` is intentionally conservative.

- `alt` returns the farthest branch failure.
- Same-position branch failures merge expected forms instead of discarding one
  branch's context.
- `opt`, `many`, and `sep-by` only recover from non-consuming failures.
- Once a nested parser has committed input, the failure stays hard and is
  propagated to the caller.
- `preceded-by`, `terminated-by`, `between`, and the `delimited-*` wrappers
  preserve those same commitment rules instead of inventing new ones.

Design grammars around that behavior. If a branch must remain backtrackable,
keep the speculative portion non-consuming until the parser reaches a true
decision point.

## Shape User-Facing Errors Deliberately

When a grammar term matters more than a raw token type, name that term in the
parser itself.

- Use `label` to replace low-level token expectations with a
  grammar-facing name such as `:binding-name`.
- Use `parse-failure->string` as the top-level renderer for user-facing parse
  errors.
- Use `run-parser` when you need to inspect recoverable diagnostics that do not
  surface through `parse-source`, `parse-all`, or `parse-tokens`.

This keeps error behavior stable for both machine-readable tests and human
readers.

## Know When To Escalate To Pratt Parsing

Stay with plain combinators when the grammar can be expressed as:

- delimited lists
- optional suffixes
- left- or right-associative chains with one precedence level
- a small fixed set of keyword-led forms

Move to Pratt parsing when you need:

- multiple precedence levels
- mixed prefix, infix, and postfix operators
- expression grammars where precedence handling would otherwise dominate the
  combinator code

Pratt parsing is not a general replacement for the rest of the library. It is
the focused tool for expression-heavy regions of a grammar.

## Upgrade Existing Parsers By Replacing Boilerplate First

When modernizing an older parser built on raw `seq` and `bind-parser` chains,
upgrade in this order:

1. Replace hand-written delimiter plumbing with `preceded-by`,
   `terminated-by`, `between`, or the `delimited-*` helpers.
2. Replace repeated operand/operator loops with `chainl1`, `chainr1`, and
   `operator-parser`.
3. Replace repeated token unwrapping with the projection helpers.
4. Move expression islands to Pratt parsing only if precedence management is
   still the main source of complexity.

That path preserves behavior while making commitment boundaries easier to read
from the parser definition itself.
