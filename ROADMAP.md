# Roadmap

`cl-parser-kit` is intentionally small. The next steps focus on keeping the API
practical, testable, and easy to audit.

## Near Term

- keep the repository-level `nix flake check` CI green so verification does not
  depend on manual local execution, and grow the enforced `coverage` gate
  alongside the parser and diagnostic surface
- keep adding targeted regression tests for portability-sensitive parser and
  diagnostic paths

## Mid Term

- keep `CHANGELOG.md` current for every tagged release
- tighten the documentation around recommended parser composition and upgrade
  patterns as the public API settles
- keep the public surface small and intentional

## Non-Goals

- compiler framework features
- editor integration
- CLI/runtime scaffolding
- large opinionated abstractions over the parser core
