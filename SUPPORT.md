# Support

`cl-parser-kit` currently defines support in terms of behavior that is verified
from this repository.

## Verified Baseline

The primary support baseline is:

```sh
sbcl --script scripts/run-tests.lisp
```

That command registers the repository's ASD metadata from the checkout root,
loads the library and test files directly, and runs the full test suite
without requiring the checkout to be pre-registered on ASDF's search path.

For raw-checkout compile validation of both shipped ASD systems, this
repository also provides:

```sh
sbcl --script scripts/run-compile-check.lisp
```

For broader local portability checks, this repository also provides:

```sh
./scripts/run-implementation-smoke.sh
```

For user-facing workflow drift checks on the shipped sample files, this
repository also provides:

```sh
sbcl --script scripts/run-examples.lisp
```

The smoke entry point is useful for broader local portability checks. It runs
the raw-checkout compile check, full test suite, and example verification
before reporting the overall result.

If the checkout is already registered with ASDF, the same test suite is also
available through:

```lisp
(asdf:load-system :cl-parser-kit-test)
(asdf:test-system :cl-parser-kit)
```

## Support Boundary

- support claims should be backed by executable tests or documented examples
- the checked-in SBCL baseline is the primary regression target
- `./scripts/run-implementation-smoke.sh` is available for broader portability
  checks when needed
- portability across other Common Lisp implementations remains a design goal,
  but it is not treated as a contract

## Release Readiness

This project does not yet ship formal versioned releases.

Before treating a checkout as a release candidate:

- pin the exact commit you intend to consume
- run `./scripts/run-release-audit.sh` to execute the checked-in release
  readiness audit in one pass
- rerun `sbcl --script scripts/run-compile-check.lisp` if the checkout changed
  system definitions, package wiring, or compile-time behavior
- rerun `sbcl --script scripts/run-tests.lisp` from that checkout
- rerun `sbcl --script scripts/run-examples.lisp` if the checkout will be
  consumed through the documented sample workflows
- ensure public docs and examples still match observed behavior
- ensure `SECURITY.md` still points reporters at the right support and contact
  path for that checkout
- ensure maintainer and governance docs still describe the active ownership
  model
- ensure `VERSIONING.md` and `RELEASING.md` still match the release policy you
  intend to communicate
